The average adult sits for six and a half hours every day, and this amount of time on a chair has a negative impact on the brain. Sitting too much, according to a 2018 study published in PLOS One, is connected to changes in a memory-related area of the brain. The medial temporal lobe (MTL), a brain region that creates new memories, was studied using MRI scans in persons aged 45 to 75. The scans were then compared to the average amount of hours people sat per day. MTL areas were thinner in those who sat the longest. MTL thinning, according to the researchers, can be a sign of cognitive decline and dementia.
